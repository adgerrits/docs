# Architecture Decision Log

The Architecture Decision Log is a collection of agreed-upon [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) (decision records).

There are various templates to express decision records. In CNO, the "simple and popular" [Michael Nygard template"](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md) is used.

The following decision records are defined, having status:
